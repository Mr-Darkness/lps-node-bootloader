## Building

If you have the needed toolchain installed on your machine just use the commands
below. If you prefer not install the toolchain you can use the 
[toolbelt](https://github.com/bitcraze/toolbelt) instead. 
In this case jsut add a ```tb``` in front of the commands, for instance 
```make clean``` would become ```tb make clean```

### Clean 

```make clean```
